## Getting Started

Utilizing DataGridLM is straightforward. Just include the JavaScript file in your project and instantiate a new grid using the provided API. From there, you can effortlessly load data, define columns, and incorporate custom user actions as required.

### npm Installation

To install your project using npm, run the following command:

```bash
$ npm install @lemonadejs/datagrid
```

### CDN

To use DataGrid via a CDN, include the following script tags in your HTML file:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lemonadejs/dist/lemonade.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@lemonadejs/datagrid/dist/index.min.js"></script>
```

### Usage

There is two ways to instantiate a DataGrid, Programatically or Dinamically

#### Programatically

Create an instance of the data grid by providing the DOM element and the **_options_** object.

```html
<div id="root"></div>
<script>
    const root = document.getElementById('root')
    Datagrid(root, {
        data: [
            { id: 1, person: 'Maria', age: 28 },
            { id: 2, person: 'Carlos', age: 33 }
        ],
        columns: [
            { name: 'person', headerName: 'Name' },
            { name: 'age', headerName: 'Age' }
        ]
    })
</script>
```

#### Dynamically with LemonadeJS

The DataGrid is invoked within the template, with the options being passed as properties.

```javascript
import Datagrid from '@lemonadejs/datagrid'
import lemonade from 'lemonadejs'

lemonade.setComponents({ Datagrid })

export default function Component() {
    let self = this

    self.data = [
        { id: 1, person: 'Maria', age: 28 },
        { id: 2, person: 'Carlos', age: 33 }
    ]

    self.columns = [
        { name: 'person', headerName: 'Name' },
        { name: 'age', headerName: 'Age' }
    ]

    return `<Datagrid data="{{self.data}}" columns="{{self.columns}}" />`
}
```

### Configuration

Additionally, you have the option of incorporating **_pagination_** and **_search_** functionalities by including them in the options. For example:

```javascript
Datagrid(root, {
    data: [
        { id: 1, person: 'Maria', age: 28 },
        { id: 2, person: 'Carlos', age: 33 }
    ],
    columns: [
        { name: 'person', headerName: 'Name' },
        { name: 'age', headerName: 'Age' }
    ],
    pagination: 5, // Each page will contain this quantity of items.
    search: true
})
```
